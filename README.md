# SimpleGFX_MyFrogger
We were tasked, as a group of 5, with 4 weeks worth of java programming experience, to learn and use a tampered/altered library through it's respective documentation to create a video game from scratch and present it in one week. My team and I created a parody of Konami's 80's classic, Frogger! 

// THE PLAN

An achievable project, agreed by all members of the team to create something arcade-y, the idea of creating a Frogger with a <A/C_> theme/twist to it was proposed, followed by the assigning of responsibilities and proceeding to develop our game!

// CHALLENGES

Multithreading was a beast, still unknown to us, which we had to tackle in order for the game engine to function and have all elements in the game working in synch with eachother.
Collision was our next hurdle. Carefully reading the SimpleGFX library + many techniques inspired from existing implementations of object collision online, helped us cross this milestone!
Deadline! As we were developing our first ever application using the little tools we had our disposal, We were, simultaneously attending to lectures and implementation exercises. Every hour counted!

We encountered some difficulties we weren't expecting such as multithreading, map creation and finding the best logic we could to have a collision for our player, we each decided to tackle a different problem while still helping each other when anyone hit a wall.

We managed to reach our objective and after a week we presented a game that accomplishes what we aimed to do, alot of polishing is still needed but we were happy with the result, after all, 3 weeks before the deadline we were learning how to do Hello World and now we had a working game.

// GIT

Git was used to spread the tasks around the team, we all created a branch from the main project and worked on our assignments, figuring out when to pull/push/merge so we could all keep working on an updated version of the project.

// CONCLUSION

Having a background in indie game development already (as the lead game artist), I found myself in comfortable grounds. Overall was really fun and we all learned alot on multiple aspects, having to go read documentation, find help online and just figure things out by testing different ideas gave us all a new perspective on the way we learn to code.
